# Line_follower-atmel_studio

The main objective of the project is to design a bot that can follow a black line on white surface autonomously using a line sensor array 
as an input sensor.
The implementation of this project helps us to explore the basic fundamental concepts of the ATMEGA 32 programmable chip.
The basic concepts implemented include PWM(Pulse Width Modulation),basic PID controller to control the basic differential system.
